# FEA Nonlinear Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict nonlinear FEA results (stress and strain) based on linear FEA outputs. This approach aims to provide faster and more cost-effective predictions compared to traditional nonlinear FEA simulations.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- **Faster Predictions:** ML models can significantly reduce prediction time compared to nonlinear FEA simulations.
- **Cost-Effective:** Reduces the computational resources.
- **Generalizable:** Well-trained models can be applied to similar materials and geometries.

**Cons:**

- **Accuracy:** Heavily dependent on the quality and diversity of training data.
- **Limited Extrapolation:** May struggle with unseen scenarios or extreme conditions.
- **Complexity:** Capturing complex nonlinear behaviors like plasticity can be challenging.


## Usage

1.  Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the models.
2.  Use the Streamlit app to make interactive predictions.
